Game ideas:
- mining-game with structure simulation, crashing mineshafts, etc.
- top-down 2d shooter (wild west?) with one room per scene, fixed camera
- Top-down 2d shooter with autoshoot (-> what is the challenge? position? cover? effects?)
- Clean up something
- Defend house, fortress (embassy?), against burglar, enemies, receive guests, top down shooter
- Typing game, mechanics ala "cook, serve, delicious" but different theme, maybe war, coffee serving, 
  -> add spin on it somehow?
- combine the above two? top-down 2d action shooter with "typing-based" mechanics for reloading, building, etc
  -> top-down shooter with WASD + Mouse action
  -> use number keys to access equipment (gun, backpack, body)
  -> use shortkeys to manipulate things
- Coffee selling ala "cook, serve, delicious"
  - operate grinder, coffee machine, etc with keys
  - client queue
  - Manage shop?
