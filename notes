Game ideas:
- mining-game with structure simulation, crashing mineshafts, etc.
- top-down 2d shooter (wild west?) with one room per scene, fixed camera
- Top-down 2d shooter with autoshoot (-> what is the challenge? position? cover? effects?)
- Clean up something
- Defend house (embassy?), against burglar, enemies, receive guests
- Typing game, mechanics ala "cook, serve, delicious" but different theme, maybe war, coffee serving, 
  -> add spin on it somehow?

Subsystems:

High prio:
- Texture handling
- Mesh files (Wavefront OBJ, MTL)
- Image files (BMP RGB + BMP Graysscale for transparency)

- Input handling (X11, Win32)

- Config files (std/parsecfg)

- Audio files (WAV)
- Audio (Alsa, Windows Waveform API?)
- Text rendering

TODO:
- move all of Makefile to config.nims
