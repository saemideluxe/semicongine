ideas:
- mining-game with structure simulation, crashing mineshafts, etc.
- top-down 2d shooter (wild west?) with one room per scene, fixed camera
- Top-down 2d shooter with autoshoot (-> what is the challenge? position? cover? effects?)
- Clean up something
- Defend house (embassy?), against burglar, enemies, receive guests
- Typing game, mechanics ala "cook, serve, delicious" but different theme, maybe war, coffee serving, 
  -> add spin on it somehow?

Subsystems:

High prio:
- Texture handling
- Input handling (X11, Win32)
- Audio (?)
- Mesh files (Wavefront OBJ, MTL)
- Image files (BMP)
- Audio files (WAV)
- Config files (TOML)
- Resource-packs (ZIP)
